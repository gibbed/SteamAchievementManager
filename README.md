# Steam Achievement Manager Auto

This is the code for SAM, originally released in 2008, last major release in 2011, and last updated in 2013 (a hotfix).

The code is being made available so that those interested can do as they like with it.

There are some changes to the code since the last closed-source release:
- General code maintenance to bring it into a more modern state.
- Icons have been replaced with ones from the Fugue Icons set.
- Version has been bumped to 7.0.x.x to indicate the open-source release.

## What's new
- A new "Unlock All" feature has been added that loops through all of the displayed games and unlocks everything automatically.

## Will I get banned for using the "Unlock All" feature?
Honestly, I'm not really sure. I doubt it's any worse than just using this program normally. I let it run through 460+ games and I'm doing fine. Please don't hold me or the original author responsible for any damages this could cause.

## Attribution

Most (if not all) icons are from the [Fugue Icons](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/) set.
